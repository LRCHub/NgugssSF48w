[00:15.09] I can't win, I can't reign
[00:18.90] I will never win this game
[00:22.09] Without you, without you
[00:30.02] I am lost, I am vain
[00:33.73] I will never be the same
[00:37.09] Without you, without you
[00:49.09] 
[00:45.05] I won't run, I won't fly
[00:48.74] I will never make it by
[00:52.00] Without you, without you
[01:00.09] I can't rest, I can't fight
[01:03.72] All I need is you and I
[01:07.08] Without you, without you
[01:19.08] 
[01:20.65] Oh-oh-oh
[01:26.02] You, you, you
[01:27.91] Without
[01:29.92] You, you, you
[01:35.49] Without you
[01:40.99] 
[01:41.17] Can't erase, so I'll take blame
[01:44.75] But I can't accept that we're estranged
[01:48.34] Without you, without you
[01:56.31] I can't quit now, this can't be right
[02:00.05] I can't take one more sleepless night
[02:03.30] Without you, without you
[02:15.30] 
[02:11.28] I won't soar, I won't climb
[02:14.86] If you're not here, I'm paralyzed
[02:18.38] Without you, without you
[02:26.24] I can't look, I'm so blind
[02:29.88] I lost my heart, I lost my mind
[02:33.32] Without you, without you
[02:45.32] 
[02:46.95] Oh-oh-oh
[02:50.46] You, you, you
[02:54.11] Without
[02:56.15] You, you, you
[03:01.75] Without you
[03:07.25] 
[03:07.53] I am lost, I am vain
[03:11.28] I will never be the same
[03:14.54] Without you, without you
[03:22.09] Without you
